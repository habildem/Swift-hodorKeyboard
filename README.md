# Hodor Keyboard 🛡️

**The only keyboard that knows one word: "HODOR!"**

### What’s Hodor Keyboard?

Once upon a time, he said Hodor. Then he said it again... and now he just can’t stop! With this fun keyboard, just click one button, and the legendary "HODOR!" appears on screen. 🤯

### How It Works

1. Click Hodor's image.
2. "HODOR!" shows up on the screen.
3. Congratulations, you’re now as charismatic as Hodor. 🎉

### Tribute to Hodor

This project is dedicated to all "minimalists" out there who, like Hodor, believe one word is enough to conquer the world.
